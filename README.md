# Introduction to Feedback Control Theory and this repository
Walkthrough of Feedback Control Theory by Doyle, Francis and Tannenbaum, Dover edition published in 2009.

## Objectives of the book
This book was written for looking at the synthesis problem when given a generalized plant, a set of exogenous inputs, and upper bound on the size of signals of interest and to design a controller to achieve this bound. 

What exactly is meant by an upper bound on the size of signals of interest varies. It could be a limited ("small") flow rate of a hydraulic valve for economic or physical constraints. Exatly what this "small" means is at the core of this book.
